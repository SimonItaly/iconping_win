Icon Ping - visual ping to 8.8.8.8, based on [antirez/iconping](https://github.com/antirez/iconping) for macOS:

> Many times I end using a computer in places with a poor or erratic wifi connection, so while I'm surfing the web, checking my email, or writing a message on Twitter, if something does not work as expected I'm not sure if the problem is my internet connection or a specific web site.
>
> My reaction when this happens is to open the Terminal application in OSX and check with a ping 8.8.8.8 command if everything is working well at least at the basic level, that is, I'm able to reach internet at all?
